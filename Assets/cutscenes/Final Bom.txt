I made him laugh! One more happy soul in the world!
I was starting to have doubts about my clown skills, to think my mom might have been right and I should find a grown up job…
But this was my final test, if I made that old fart have a good time I can do anything! I’m a proper clown! 
Look at me now, mom!
